# A helper kernel module to benchmark stacktrace map

**Work in progress**

This module adds a function which will be predictably executed on a given stack
depth.

The benchmark itself is currently a draft, see the
[bpf-bench-stacktrace](https://github.com/aspsk/bpf-next/tree/aspsk/bpf-bench-stacktrace)
branch for the code.
